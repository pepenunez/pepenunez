Hi! I'm Pepe ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing a Data Analytics bootcamp in Berlin to acquire some hard skills that enable me to use data to make informed Product / Business decisions. 

Quick intro to the projects that I've been working on: 

- final-project: (work in progress)

- project-3: Data Visualizations with Tableau
- project-2: COVID impact on household energy consumption
