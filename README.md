Hi! I'm Pepe ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as **Teacher Assistant** at Ironhack Berlin. 

I graduated from the Data Analytics Bootcamp in August 2020. My main motivation to do the bootcamp was to acquire some *coding skills* to use data to make informed Product / Business decisions. Those skills will complement my +3 years of experience in the field. 

Quick intro to the projects that I've been working on: 

- **final-project:** (work in progress)
- **project-4:** Data Analytics for Product Management
- **project-3:** Data Visualizations with Tableau
- **project-2:** COVID impact on household energy consumption
- **project-1:** Build your own game with Python
